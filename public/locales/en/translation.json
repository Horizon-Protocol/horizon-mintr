        "description": "HZN stakers receive two kinds of rewards. Firstly, they receive HZN staking rewards, which are created through the inflationary monetary policy. Secondly, there’s the zAsset exchange rewards, which are generated by zAsset trades on the upcoming Horizon DEX."

        "title": "What do HZN stakers need to do?",
        "description": "All zAssets need to be backed by staked HZN at a Collateralization Ratio of 750%.  HZN stakers need to manage their own ratio to be above this figure, which they can do by burning zAssets to increase their ratio or minting hAsssets to reduce it. If they do this, they can collect weekly rewards."

      "risks": {
        "title": "What are the risks?",
        "description": "All HZN stakers create a ‘debt’ when they stake.  Their debt begins as the amount of zUSD they initially mint, and fluctuates according to gains or losses made by other zAsset holders.  Any time anyone holds a zAsset that appreciates in value, that gain is distributed proportionally between the staked HZN holders’ debts. A staker must pay off their debt before they can unlock their staked HZN."
